# Nysus — Build Progress

> Persistent memory across sessions. Any agent resuming work reads this file **first**, then `git log --oneline -20`, then tries `npm run dev`. Do **not** restart from Phase 0 if this file says Phase 0 is complete.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold

Status: **committed — awaiting user verification**
Last action: Committed Phase 0 on branch `main`. Working tree clean, git fsck clean, no secret patterns in the staged diff (checked before commit).
Next action: User runs `npm install && npm run dev` locally. Because Phase 1 is also committed, running dev without Supabase env will land on the **`/setup`** page (by design — middleware short-circuits to `/setup` until Supabase env is populated). Phase 0 visual check is still valid there: cream bg, navy wordmark, Caveat highlight on "setup", thin rule, "after Dionysus" footer. If those render, scaffold is good.
Blockers: None on my side. **User verification required** (see _How to verify Phase 0 + 1_ below).

---

## Phase 1 — Auth + Supabase

Status: **committed — awaiting user verification**
Last action: Wrote the full schema migration, the "I Don't Even Like You Tho" seed project, typed Supabase client helpers (browser / server / service-role), magic-link login with ALLOWED_EMAIL gate at three layers, middleware-based session refresh, and projects CRUD (list / new / detail stub).
Next action: User creates Supabase project, runs `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` in the SQL editor, sets Auth redirect URL to `<APP_URL>/auth/callback`, populates `.env.local`, restarts dev. Sign in with magic link, create a project, see it at `/`. Optionally run `supabase/seed/example_project.sql` to bootstrap the example series.
Blockers: Supabase env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ALLOWED_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`) need to be set before Phase 1 routes will boot — without them, every request 302s to `/setup`.

Files added:

- `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` — projects, clips, messages; RLS on all three (auth.uid() = user_id direct or joined); storage bucket `clips`; `touch_updated_at` trigger
- `supabase/seed/example_project.sql` — "I Don't Even Like You Tho" with David + Maya character sheet + aesthetic bible
- `lib/env.ts` — typed env getters (throw on missing) + `envStatus()` / `isSupabaseConfigured()` for graceful degradation
- `lib/auth.ts` — `isAllowedEmail` / `assertAllowedEmail`
- `lib/projects.ts` — Zod input schema for project CRUD
- `lib/shot-prompt.ts` — Zod schema + `extractShotPrompts` for the Phase-3 `json-shot` parser (shipped early so types line up)
- `lib/supabase/types.ts` — hand-typed `Database` (regenerate via `supabase gen types` once project is live)
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client (`createBrowserClient`)
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — cookies-aware server client + service-role client
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — session refresh helper
- `middleware.ts` — root middleware: short-circuit to `/setup` if Supabase unconfigured, otherwise require session + ALLOWED_EMAIL, bounce signed-in users away from `/login`
- `app/setup/page.tsx` — env-status landing with per-phase checklist and Supabase quickstart
- `app/login/{page,login-form,actions}.tsx` — magic-link form (server action), ALLOWED_EMAIL gate at send time
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` — exchange code for session, second ALLOWED_EMAIL check, sign out + redirect if mismatch
- `app/auth/signout/route.ts` — POST-only signout
- `app/actions.ts` — `createProject`, `deleteProject` server actions
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced placeholder with authenticated projects list + empty state
- `app/projects/new/{page,new-project-form}.tsx` — title + description form
- `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` — workspace stub with timeline / chat placeholders (real impl in Phase 3/4) + character sheet + aesthetic bible panels

Security posture:

- ALLOWED_EMAIL enforced at three layers: login server action, `/auth/callback` post-exchange, middleware on every request.
- Service-role key only imported by server files; never exposed to browser.
- `/setup` is the only unauthenticated route once env is configured; middleware redirects signed-out users to `/login` (and Phase-1-unconfigured to `/setup`).
- RLS policies cover select / insert / update / delete on all three tables.

Files touched:

- `package.json` — renamed to `nysus`, added `typecheck` script
- `.gitignore` — hardened (`.env.*`, `secrets.txt`, `*.secrets`, editor/OS dirs)
- `.env.example` — canonical env template (new)
- `app/layout.tsx` — Cormorant Garamond + Inter + Caveat + JetBrains Mono, manifest + viewport theme-color
- `app/page.tsx` — Nysus placeholder
- `app/globals.css` — Tailwind v4 `@theme inline` with full Director's Desk palette + typography + motion tokens
- `app/icon.png`, `app/favicon.ico` — placeholder N-mark
- `public/manifest.webmanifest` — PWA manifest
- `public/icons/icon-{192,512,maskable,favicon-32}.png` — placeholder icons (replaced in Phase 2)
- `public/{next,vercel,window,file,globe}.svg` — neutralized (empty SVG; fuse mount wouldn't let me delete in sandbox)

### Deviations from the brief (flagged for user approval)

1. **Next.js 16, not 15.** `create-next-app@latest` pulls Next 16.2.4 with Tailwind v4. App Router is unchanged; this is backward-compatible. Keep, or downgrade?
2. **`next-pwa` deferred to Phase 9.** It has known incompatibilities with Next 16 App Router. Phase 0 ships a static `manifest.webmanifest` + theme-color meta (the 80% of PWA that matters). Full service-worker setup is more appropriate next to the "completed state" polish anyway.
3. **Illustrations skipped in Phase 2** per your instruction. Placeholder "N" icons used for PWA icons + favicon. Real Flux 1.1 Pro batch still documented in the brief; you can trigger it separately.
4. **Critique button label** will be `Consult the chorus` when Phase 6 lands, per your tweak.
5. **Pre-flight model verification skipped** per your instruction. Before Phase 3/4 we'll use these defaults; verify with me before cutover:
   - Replicate Seedance 2.0 slug: `bytedance/seedance-2-0` (assumed — **verify before Phase 4**)
   - OpenRouter Claude model ID: `anthropic/claude-opus-4` (assumed — **verify before Phase 3**)
6. **`npm install` not run in the sandbox.** The virtiofs mount I'm working through has rename/rm permission glitches mid-install that corrupt `node_modules`. You run `npm install` on your Mac where it'll work. Your machine is also where `next dev` actually renders — this sandbox doesn't forward localhost to you anyway.

## How to verify Phase 0 + 1 on your machine

### Step 1 — install and boot

```bash
cd /Users/becareful/Movies/Nysus
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2 — Phase 0 visual (zero env needed)

Without any env set, the middleware redirects everything to `/setup`. You should see:

- Cream (`#F5EFE0`) page background
- Navy (`#1B2A3A`) Cormorant "NYSUS" wordmark with letter-spacing
- Handwritten tagline in Caveat with a yellow highlighter streak
- "after Dionysus" footer in small caps
- A status table showing which env vars are missing, and a numbered Supabase quickstart

If the design system renders correctly there, Phase 0 is green.

### Step 3 — Phase 1 setup

1. Create a Supabase project (see the quickstart on `/setup`).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the Supabase + app values. Use the tokens staged in `secrets.txt` for Replicate / OpenRouter / the two Supabase JWTs.
3. In the Supabase SQL editor, paste and run `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`.
4. In Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration, add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (and `https://nysus.media/auth/callback` once you have prod) as an allowed redirect.
5. Restart `npm run dev`.

### Step 4 — Phase 1 visual + flow

- `/` should now 302 to `/login`.
- Sign in with your email; magic link lands in your inbox.
- Clicking the link redirects to `/auth/callback` and then `/`, which now shows the empty-projects state (the "∅" + "the notebook is empty" copy).
- Tap "+ new →", create a project ("I Don't Even Like You Tho" is fine), land on the workspace stub with timeline / chat placeholders + character sheet + aesthetic bible panels.
- Optionally run `supabase/seed/example_project.sql` to get the David/Maya seed project populated.

If all that works, Phase 1 is green — reply "Phase 1 looks good" and I start Phase 3 (skipping Phase 2 illustrations per your earlier choice; we can revisit them any time).

## Environment checklist

Stashed secrets live in `secrets.txt` (gitignored, never commit). Copy them into `.env.local` before Phase 1 in the shape of `.env.example`.

| Variable | Staged in secrets.txt? | Required before | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | ✓ | Phase 4 | Scope to this app. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ✓ | Phase 3 | Set a monthly cap in the dashboard. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ✓ (unlabeled) | Phase 1 | In secrets.txt under the plain `Supabase:` label — move to this var name when you create `.env.local`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✓ (unlabeled) | Phase 1 | In secrets.txt under `Supabase anonpublic:` — same note. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | ✗ | Phase 1 | `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co`. Get it from the Supabase project settings. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | ✗ | Phase 1 (magic-link redirect) | `http://localhost:3000` in dev; `https://nysus.media` in prod. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | ✗ | Phase 4 (webhook + cron) | Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL` | ✗ | Phase 1 (magic-link gate) | Your email. |
| `CRITIQUE_MODE` | ✓ | Phase 6 | Must equal `on_demand`. |

**Reminder**: never paste a secret value into source, comments, commit messages, or chat. Before every commit, run `git diff --staged` and visually confirm no tokens leaked.

## Session resume protocol

If a session dies mid-phase, the next agent:

1. Reads this file first.
2. Runs `git log --oneline -20` to see what was actually committed.
3. Runs `npm run dev` (after `npm install` if needed) to confirm the current tree boots.
4. Reports the phase it's resuming from before doing any new work. Never restart a completed phase.

## Commit log (tracked manually as a fallback)

- Phase 0: scaffold Nysus — Next 16 + TS + Tailwind v4 + Director's Desk tokens + PWA manifest + placeholder icons
- Phase 1: Supabase schema + RLS + magic-link auth (ALLOWED_EMAIL gate at 3 layers) + projects CRUD + /setup fallback. See `git log`.
